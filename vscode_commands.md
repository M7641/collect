# VSCode Commands 

Now that I am using this IDE a lot more, it is making more and more sense to just learn all the short cuts. The plan is not ever have to touch the mouse.

1. `ctrl + .` with the spell checker, actually, may work for all `quick fix` suggestions.
2. `ctrl + '` will swap you from the editor to the terminal. I don't like the way it closes it when I am not on it though. 
3. `ctrl + w` will close the page you are on.
4. `ctrl + g` will let you navigate to another line in the file you are in.
5. `alt + < or >` is how you move to the start or end of a line in VS.
6. `ctrl + tab` lets you select which file to go on in this window.
7. `ctrl + alt + up or down` will select multiple lines.
8. `shift + alt + RightArrow` expands the select to the next largest object. So you can select the whole line by doing this twice.
9. `alt + up or down` with a line selected will move the entire line.
10. `ctrl + l` to select the whole line.
11. `ctrl + 1/2/3` to select the editor group. This will let us move about between the open editor groups when we want.
12. `ctrl + H` is a dedicated replace, you don't have to find it first and then click the button.
13. `home` to move to the start of the line.
14. `end` to move to the end of the line.

This really does take some practice to learn. Further compounded due to the differences with Mac being somewhat confusing to me.
