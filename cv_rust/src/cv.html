                <p class="summary-text">
                    I am a Lead Machine Learning Engineer at UiPath, a Software-as-a-service company, since 2020. Previously, I was a Quantitative Analyst for the management consultancy Oliver Wyman. My higher education was in Mathematics (MSci) from Lancaster University. I also did a year abroad at Western University in Ontario, Canada.

                <p class="summary-text">
                    At Peak, I develop and deploy applications powered by Machine Learning (ML) models. I am responsible for end-to-end delivery, including data engineering, building machine learning models, providing outputs through web applications and APIs, and proving added business value through A/B testing. I have over seven years of experience in Python, R and multiple dialects of SQL. I'm driven by the desire to improve and optimise business processes continuously.

                    <ul>
                        <li>My projects have been focused on Customer propensity models, Customer LTV models, Recommendation systems, e-commerce pricing and markdown optimisation. I act as the primary contact for the customer during solution deployment, hence I have experience in stakeholder management and presenting to non-technical audiences, including the C-Suite level.</li>

                        <li>A few projects of mine are:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Developing a solution to explain black-box machine learning models using SHAP values. The primary use case was to advise on financial services product strategy by providing insights into the 17 separate customer propensity models that I developed.</li>

                                <li>Deploying a markdown optimisation tool for a major UK fashion retailer with intense deadlines. This solution increased gross margin by 9.4ppt with comparable sell-through rates, as proven by an A/B test.</li>

                                <li>Developing a P&L application in a month that was used to identify 10 Million pounds of savings within a medium-sized retail business.</li>

                                <li>Delivering a recommendation engine used within the CRM D365 to generate 2 Million pounds of additional annual revenue for a manufacturing business along side other models such as a Customer LTV model.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                        <li>The technical skills I use daily are data importing from various sources such as SFTP servers, REST Apis, and AWS's S3. Data engineering through DBT on Data Warehouses such as AWS's Redshift and Snowflake. Python is used in developing ML models, primarily using TensorFlow. APIs in FastAPI and Dash for Web Applications. The DevOps tools include git for version control, docker for containerisation, and pre-commit hooks for code hygiene. I adopt the best technology for the job and continuously look for new ways to boost productivity.</li>

                        <li>Outside of project delivery, I contribute to Peak's core products. I developed the first version of our markdown application's front end and contribute React components to our component library. Also, I am involved in various initiatives to improve code quality, including creating Python templates. I also help to maintain our internal tooling.</li>

                        <li>Finally, I mentor several Data Scientists through coaching, technical support and project guidance. This includes revising timelines and identifying risks in the projects for which my team is responsible.</li>
