# projects

This is a collection of projects that I have done on my own that have also been used professionally. Albeit in a Proof of Concept (PoC) capacity.

1. Cartridge is to act like a template. The idea is you initiate a simple project through cartridge and you can then add modules to it. Rather than having a large template and cutting down, this will be starting from the bare minimum and adding what you need.
2. Metis is a web app that explains model outputs. It uses SHAP to do this.
3. Proteus is a framework for making machine learning models for customer behavior prediction.

Me doing them a sole contributor has led to issues. My Git hygiene has not been good enough and I've not included tests.
